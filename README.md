# kCRFC

This is the R code to implement the simulations and real data analysis of the following paper:
> Hyunsung Kim and Yaeji Lim (2022+). Functional clustering on a sphere via Riemannian functional principal components, *under review.*

## Description

- **functions.R** : R functions to implement the proposed **kCRFC** and other functions are included.
- **simulation.R** : Simulation code for the curves on a 2-dimensional sphere
- **simulation_S3.R** : Simulation code for the curves on a 3-dimensional sphere
- **bird_bigration_clust.R** : Real data clustering of Egyptian vultures in the Middle East and East Africa (2-dimensional sphere)
- **medfly_clust.R** : Real data clustering of compositional medfly data (3-dimensional sphere)
- **clust_validation.R** : Clustering validation from real data clustering of compositional medfly data (3-dimensional sphere)
